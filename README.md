# Simple-Meme-Command
A simple meme command which uses an API to grab memes from subreddits. It also includes a button so that you can keep looking through memes without running the command continuously. This command is coded in TypeScript. If you decide to change the code to fit your handler I will not be providing support.  Dependencies ~axios - npm i axios~
